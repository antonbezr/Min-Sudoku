# Min-Sudoku

## Demo
The game can be found here: https://min-sudoku.netlify.app/ (Server may take a few seconds to start up).

## Backend

The backend of the project is implemented using PHP and Python. The PHP code is stored on the server and allows users to make databse requests. The Python code is stored locally and allows the admin to upload Sudoku puzzles to the server. The backend repository is hosted on Heroku and can be viewed here: https://github.com/antonbezr/Min-Sudoku-Backend.
